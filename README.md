# About Job-ish 💼 # 

🔗 https://job-ish.vercel.app/

Everyone's talking about ChatGPT and whilst I love using it as a tool to help me learn, I wanted to explore using the OpenAI API.

To create Job-ish, I initially followed tutorial to help me understand the OpenAI API. Once I got the MVP of my app working I challenge myself to refactoring for clean code practises by breaking down each segment into separate, reuseable components. 

This project was a fantastic exercise for me in passing props effectively from parent to child components as well as handling multiple useState hooks. I'm interested in stretching this a bit further and creating multiple different forms with other prompts to request from the OpenAI API. 

I'm currently troubleshooting a trim() method issue in production to actually getr the job description generated. the app works perfectly in playground thought! I will update when the live app is working again.
